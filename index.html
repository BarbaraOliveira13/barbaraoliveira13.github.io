                Hello, I am Barbara ðŸ––, and this is our final bootcamp project, created in a team from scratch. Cinehunt is a
                <strong>travel app that catalogs cinematic filming locations</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                With it, we can discover our favorite movie locations or explore movies filmed around us, providing useful details about visiting these places.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a <strong>collaborative application</strong>, meaning that as a regular user, you can request and add new scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The exciting part is that on-site, we can use <strong>augmented reality</strong>
                <strong>to reveal the exact filming location</strong>. This way, we can figure out precisely where the scene and characters were filmed.
            </p>
